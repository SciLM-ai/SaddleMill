"""Regression guard on the ASE installation linked to SaddleMill (not on
SaddleMill itself).

VASP's VTST dimer requires the ``DROTMAX`` INCAR tag to be an *integer*; a
decimal form such as ``10.000000`` is silently rejected and VASP falls back to
its default (``RotMax 4``). ASE historically filed ``drotmax`` under
``float_keys``, so its ``write_incar`` formatted it with ``FLOAT_FORMAT``
(``'5.6f'``) and emitted ``DROTMAX = 10.000000`` even when handed an ``int``.
The linked ASE must instead classify ``drotmax`` as an integer key so that a
config value of ``drotmax = 10`` (which SaddleMill's ConfigManager infers as a
Python ``int``) is written as ``DROTMAX = 10``.

This test only generates and parses INCAR text — it never runs VASP and needs
no POTCARs.
